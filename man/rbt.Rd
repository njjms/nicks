\title{Randomized Binomial Test}
\usage{
rbt(x, n, p_h0, alpha = 0.05, alternative = "lt")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{observed count}

\item{n}{total count}

\item{p_h0}{probability under the null hypothesis}

\item{alpha}{defaults to .05}

\item{alternative}{form of alternative hypothesis, can be "lt" or "gt"}
}
\value{
Single boolean; TRUE for rejection, FALSE for non-rejection
}
\description{
In short, an RBT rejects borderline cases with \gamma probability. 
Whereas tests on binomial data as performed with Clopper-Pearson intervals 
or Wilson Score intervals usually have test size < nominal significance \alpha
level, an RBT will be guaranteed to always have theoretical size == \alpha.

\details{
Further detail can be found on: http://nicksun.fun/statistics/2020/11/16/sawtooth-power-curves.html

The purpose of the rbt() function is to provide a comparison against Wilson
and Clopper-Pearson based testing.

  output[i] <- rbt(x=7, n=100, alpha=.05, alternative="lt")
